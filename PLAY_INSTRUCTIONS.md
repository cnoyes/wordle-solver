Loading strategy...
âœ“ Strategy loaded (6 turns)

ðŸ“– HOW TO PLAY
1. I'll suggest the optimal guess
2. Enter this word into Wordle
3. Tell me the color feedback you received
4. Repeat until solved!

Color codes:
  ðŸŸ© = Letter in correct position (green)
  ðŸŸ¨ = Letter in word, wrong position (yellow)
  â¬œ = Letter not in word (gray)

=======================================================
  TURN 1
=======================================================

ðŸ’¡ Optimal guess:  RAISE

Enter the color feedback you received:
  Position 1 (g=green, y=yellow, r=red): _
```

## How to Play

### Step 1: Get the Optimal Guess
The solver suggests **RAISE** as your first guess.

### Step 2: Play Wordle
Go to https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html and enter **RAISE**

### Step 3: Enter the Colors
For each letter position (1-5), enter the color you see:
- Type **`g`** for green (correct letter, correct position)
- Type **`y`** for yellow (correct letter, wrong position)
- Type **`r`** for red/gray (letter not in word)

### Example

If Wordle shows:
```
R A I S E
â¬œðŸŸ¨ðŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œ
```

You would enter:
```
Position 1: r
Position 2: y
Position 3: g
Position 4: r
Position 5: r
```

### Step 4: Get Next Guess
The solver will show you the optimal next guess based on the feedback!

### Step 5: Repeat
Continue until you solve the puzzle (all green) or run out of guesses.

## Tips

- **Type carefully**: Make sure colors match exactly what Wordle shows
- **One letter at a time**: The solver asks for each position separately
- **Green = g, Yellow = y, Red/Gray = r**: Short codes work fine
- **Win message**: You'll see a celebration when you solve it!

## Common Issues

### "Script hangs at loading"
- This is normal if it takes 5-10 seconds to load the strategy data
- Wait for "âœ“ Strategy loaded"

### "Invalid input" message
- Only type: `g`, `y`, `r` (or `green`, `yellow`, `red`)
- Press Enter after each letter

### "Could not find matching outcome"
- Double-check your color entries
- Make sure they match exactly what Wordle showed
