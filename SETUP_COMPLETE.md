# ✅ Setup Complete!

Your Wordle solver is now **ready to use**!

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Word List Loading ✅
**Problem**: Original URL for downloading Wordle words no longer works (NYT moved the game)

**Solution**:
- Copied your legacy word lists to `data/raw/`
- Updated `01_setup_data.R` to use existing files if present
- Falls back to download only if needed

**Status**: ✅ 2,314 answer words + 10,656 guess words loaded

### 2. Strategy Data ✅
**Problem**: Strategy tree takes 18-30 minutes to build

**Solution**:
- Copied your pre-computed legacy strategy files to `data/derived/`
- You can skip the long computation step

**Status**: ✅ Complete strategy tree ready to use

### 3. Interactive CLI ✅
**Problem**: Column naming mismatch between new scripts and legacy data

**Solution**:
- Fixed `play_wordle.R` to work with your legacy data structure
- Opening guess: **RAISE**

**Status**: ✅ Ready to play!

## 🎮 How to Use

### Play Wordle with Optimal Suggestions

```bash
cd ~/code/wordle-solver
Rscript scripts/play_wordle.R
```

**What happens**:
1. Suggests "RAISE" as opening guess
2. You enter colors (g/y/r) for each position
3. Gets next optimal guess
4. Repeat until solved!

### Example Session

```
💡 Optimal guess:  RAISE

Enter the color feedback you received:
  Position 1 (g=green, y=yellow, r=red): r
  Position 2 (g=green, y=yellow, r=red): y
  Position 3 (g=green, y=yellow, r=red): g
  Position 4 (g=green, y=yellow, r=red): r
  Position 5 (g=green, y=yellow, r=red): r

You entered:
 R  A  I  S  E
▓▓ 🟨 🟩 ▓▓ ▓▓

  TURN 2

💡 Optimal guess:  FATAL
...
```
